ST05: Creating the environment for the basic ETT setting
- Build the ETT application for a short tour with only one predictor agent.
- Creating a GUI for problem visualization. 
  - The GUI app should show historical data of vessel movement and speed. 
  - On request of an ETT (Estimated travel time), the actual data must also be shown.

ST06: Building an infrastructure for distributed decision making
- A broker agent can serve requests of clients that want to have an ETT prediction of a vessel. 
- The broker agent learns the weightings for all service providers and integrates the prediction of all ETT predictor agents.
